GAME Is like a small tour of what might or will happen in the future sorta

Cardboard Challenge (MAYBE)
Pew Pew Pew! - Sound by voices only
Minimalism - Least amount of code
Reverse Storytelling - Maybe (Shows how it ends, then it ends how it started ❤️)


CONTRAST: Dark level being easy when peacful level is most difficult (cause its impossible to go back at that rate)

Game:
Level 3 to Level 1
End cut scene shows zoom out of earth from normal, to having spots turning red/black from fires. Then maybe shows a meteor on the way then cuts off.
Maybe message reads during cutscsne of after cut off like pikmin


Out of bounds secrets l Hollow Knight- Boundary Break
(See behind the scenes to check how parallax works)
(Layers in background..etc)

Maybe text /subtitles from character saying what's happening at the moment, or like story form like this is all a memory

Ideas:
Stage 1:  the world was uch a beautiful place, so much nature, trees, flowers, animals.. etc
Stage 2: then, all of it started getting worse by the humans living on this earth, killing nature.. etc
Stage 3: And this is where it all ended... .etc

Stage 3 Colour scheme (Night) - Take inspo from steven universe maybe
